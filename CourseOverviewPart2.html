            <!-- there is a hierarchy of headers used with the main header using the h1 tag and all subsequent sub headers use the h2 tag -->
            <p>
                CSF is split into two parts, The first is a logical based unit that focuses on binary logic gates and boolean expressions along with Karnaugh maps via the use of the <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/" title="Logisim website"> Logisim </a> digital logic circuit simulator software that allows such circuits to be tested on a PC or MAC. Lectures will discuss: Components of a CPU. Processor Model. Fetch execute cycle. hardware interrupts. Assembly Language Programming: Relationship between high level Languages and Assembler. Instruction sets. Registers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the unit focuses on discrete mathematics and how it's tied into computer science featuring topics such as Matrices as linear transforms. Functions: definition, properties. Sets: subsets, set algebra, Logic: Propositions, Predicates, propositional algebra, proof of simple results.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this unit I have been able to extend my previous knowledge of binary logic gates and boolean expressions by taking advantage of the Logisim software in both lab sessions and my own free time in order to understand how advanced circuits can be created via a combination of gates such as AND, OR, NOT and XOR being fed an input and being able to display an output visual often through a visual effect such as a digital led changing from red to green. I made sure to prepare for the test that took place regarding boolean logic and binary gates thanks to this software which also contains a feature called combinational analysis that allows the user to enter in truth tables from a set of inputs and outputs and let logisim create and build the circuit without me having to place the individual gates, this feature was invaluable during my exam.

            <h2>Programming</h2>

            <p> Learning to program is the most important aspect of the degree as it underpins many of the later units you will cover and introduces a new way of thinking logically, solving problems and troubleshooting errors. This unit introduces computer programming in a high level programming language Java and includes principles and practice in problem solving, program design, solution implementation and testing. These skills can only be acquired by practice and perseverance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aims of the unit will be to develop a simple vocabulary of commands,syntax and programming constructs using <a href="https://www.processing.org" title="Processing website">Processing</a> (graphical Java, simple development environment). Developing problem solving skills, moving to console applications (with a more professional Java development environment) refining and building on knowledge of programming constructs On successful completion of this unit I'll be able to apply the main structuring features of the chosen high level programming language(s) to solve a variety of problems. Design well-structured solutions to a problem of varying complexity using appropriate methods. Implement well-structured solutions to a variety of problems using the appropriate techniques and a high-level programming language. Apply object oriented design to model a variety of real world (type) problems construct and apply suitable software tests.

                Having taken computer science at both GCSE and A-Level, I have a background with programming which means I feel very at home with this module of the course, however I'm new to Java so the experience is fresh, ive been taking advantage of online programming sites like <a href="http://www.codingbat.com" title="Coding bats website">Codingbat</a> which offer many different types of exercises ranging from logic to recursion that are all based on Java, allowing me to both practice my abilities as well as my knowledge of Java syntax.
